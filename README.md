# LegoStax's Dotfiles

This v2.0 branch will be developed later in 2018. I have a lot of projects that have deadlines right now. Plus, I need to get lots of ideas to make an entirely new experience that integrates better, provides more relevant information, etc.

In the meantime, check out the planned features below, or [head back to the master stable branch](https://github.com/legostax/dotfiles)

Dependencies: AwesomeWM, mpd, PulseAudio

## Features
- Multi-monitor support
- Animations via `tween.lua`
- Custom integrated lockscreen
- Music (MPD) integration into the main bar
- Set the default audio output in the main bar
- Client border colors change based on application class name
- Tiling (most clients will be maximized anyway)
- Useless gaps
- CPU and RAM usage info in main bar
- Conky for LAN info
- Either rofi launcher or custom compact launcher
- Quite a few keyboard shortcuts

I want this new setup to be very feature-filled
