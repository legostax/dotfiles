# LegoStax's Dotfiles

Here's the files that enable AwesomeWM to work how I want on my machine.  [Check it out on Reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/6drt6c/awesomewm_noobs_paradise/)

Dependencies: AwesomeWM, mpd, Pulseaudio

3/4 Wallpapers were found browsing the interwebs.  The Daft Punk one was made by one of my [buddies](https://twitter.com/VoltivTV).

## Setup/Installation

- Install AwesomeWM 4.2
- Clone this repository into `~/.config/awesome/`
- Edit `themes/default/theme.lua` to match the location of your `~/.config/awesome`
- Make changes to the audio input setup to ensure that the music player will work with your audio setup
- Change the `screenLockPin` to something other than the default **1234**

Right-click on the desktop and click Hotkeys to see a list of all of the keybinds.

Ensure your `~/.face` is at least 400x400 in size for the lockscreen to look right.

Poke around for other things to tweak to your liking. Have fun!
